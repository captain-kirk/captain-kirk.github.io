When people who want to learn how to code, I generally tell them to start with Python. In my opinion, Python is the easiest language to digest if you have no programming experience. Why? Python is easily human readable. It is a logical language, meaning it's easy to pick up (due to its readability) and THEN pick up the concepts behind programming languages. The language itself is pretty intuitive. Python lacks the syntax requirements of languages such as C# and Java. The documentation is easy to understand. Given all this, YOU (yes you) can start writing programs today. With Python you can write with very simple programs with little experience.

In 2015, I took an Intro to Data Science course. The following post is based off the rubric created by that class, taught by Peter Drake.

## Using codecademy

Before taking the aforementioned class, I had never used Python before. We learned the basics of Python using codeacademy, which is completely FREE. All you need is an email to sign up.

If you’d like to take the Python 3 course, you’ll need to sign up for the Pro version of the site. This is not necessary, in my opinion. Starting with the Python 2 course is a great first step. 

If you’ve already started learning Python, I recommend you jump right into a more advanced course. Upon my own research I discovered the Become a Data Scientist course on codeacademy. It requires the Pro version. You can start with a trail and see if it suits your learning style.

## Practicing Your Python Skills

In my data science course, we wrote scripts to solve real life problems. This is the key to mastering programming: understanding how to address every day programs with code. You want to be able to encounter a problem and figure out how to solve that problem using your language of choice. 

The first step to this is pseudocode. When developers write pseudocode, they are using plain English to define each step of their algorithm or script. Writing out the steps of your solution is always an important beginning step to writing code. 

Our brains remember things better when they are conceptualized in real life solutions. This is why I recommend the following sites to practice your Python skills. 

[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)

One important application of data science is in DNA and genetic coding. If you remember high school biology, you will recall terms such as RNA, amino acids, and proteins. Roslind is named after Rosalind Franklin, an important figure in the discovery of DNA, RNA, coal, graphite, and viruses. 

Rosalind uses presents problems based on concepts of bioinformatics. It presents problems and then checks them automatically. The way you choose to implement is your choice. For each problem, a Google search is certain to reveal a number of implementations. 

To solve Rosalind problems I recommend taking the following approach:

1. Make sure you understand the problem. Google any terms of concepts you don’t understand. Find YouTube videos that explain things you don’t understand. There are countless resources at your disposal. 
2. Once you understand the concept behind your problem, write pseudocode. Write out each step you required to transform your input to the expected output. Find examples of pseudocode online to become more familiar with the various approaches. 
3. Now write code. Use concepts and tools such as loops, lists, dictionaries, functions, and libraries to solve your problem. Stack Overflow is an excellent resource for finding examples of implementation and usage. Be careful not to spoil your solution! 

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

If you’re the kind of person who likes math, sequences, or puzzles, Project Euler is for you. The site offers a long list of computational problems that can be solved by computer programs. For instance, a problem might challenge you to find the first 100 numbers of the Fibonnaci sequence. 

Follow the same approach listed above to solve these problems.

## Taking your skills to the next level 

Once you are confident in your Python skills, I challenge you to write an API. If you are unfamiliar with the concept, here are some resources:
