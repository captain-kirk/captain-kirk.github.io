When people ask me how I got into tech, I usually tell them I had the most traditional path. And it’s true, I did things the old fashioned way: went to college, majored in math & computer science, graduated, got an internship, and after two months I transitioned to full time as an engineer. While I will say that yes, most of the other engineers and developers I work with went to college, this isn’t the only path. I’ve worked with people from various backgrounds; some had a career in a completely different field before transitioning to tech. 

Here are some tips if you're looking to get into tech (See end for DevOps specific information). 

## Going to college

Given my high school transcript and financial aid, going to college was the most straight forward choice for me. It was economical because I was able to get most of the costs covered by the college or student loans. If you're the type of person who wants to go to college and you want to get into tech, I recommend taking computer science and math classes. This **will not** teach you everything you need to know. It will create a foundation for you to build. Here's a rundown of the most important classes I took and what I got from them: 

* CS1: Learned C, emacs, command line basics (sftp, ssh, cp, cd, ls, mv)
* CS2: Learned Java and the ins and outs of object oriented programming
* Algorithm Design & Analysis: how to write algorithms to maximize efficiency
* Architecture and Assembly: how code works with operating systems
* Data Science: Learned Python, how to leverage python libraries to process data 
* Intro to Cybersecurity: basic linux defense best practices, cryptography, encryption, firewalls, how packets are transmitted, network protocols & other networking basics 

Keep in mind that you don’t have to enroll in a 4 year degree program right away. Most, if not all, community colleges offer some type of programming or computer science class. Start out by enrolling in an intro class, to see where your interests lie. 

## Going to a code bootcamp

Bootcamps are popping up all over the country. Why? Because they are both more cost and time effective than college. Think of bootcamps as trade schools for people who want to become developers. I’ve worked with many developers who went to bootcamp and they stand out as some of the most well rounded people in engineering.  Each bootcamp has its own type of courses: back end, front end, full stack, data science, UX, cybersecurity, iOS development, the list goes on. Take the time to figure out what you might be interested in doing with your tech skills before you settle on a program. Remember: tech jobs exists everywhere, not just within tech companies.  Though I cannot specifically recommend one bootcamp or the other, here are a few examples to get you started on your research:

## Teach yourself

With all the resources available online, this is much easier than you think. However, it can be intimidating because of the amount of content available. This track depends on how self-motivated you are. Check out these options: 

[MIT offers their courses online for free](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-topic/#cat=engineering&subcat=computerscience)

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/browse/computer-science) has hundreds of courses available from real colleges. Some free, some not. [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/it-and-software/) is another great option, especially because their courses are often on sale for $15 or less.

[PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) markets itself as a tech skills platform. A previous job had us take a OWASP Top 10 course on PluralSight and it was well organized, digestible, and memorable. It’s not free, but you can start with a 10 day trial according to their website.

## Take me straight to DevOps 

DevOps is development operations. The role of a DevOps Engineer is to take the code from the developers and release it into the world. As straightforward as it seems, a lot goes into releasing an app in production. If you don’t know anything about that, don’t fret. 

When I started working, I was an intern building an internal app for the engineering and customer success teams. After the conclusion of that project, I started helping my manager work on the company SOCII report. During that time I dove into AWS pretty intensely and learned how to automate audits because I was tired of doing them manually. My job became figuring out how to make sure our infrastructure was available, secure and compliant. I created proof of concepts for solutions to our top issues, pitched them to teams, and helped roll it out once they were onboard. 

That last sentence is the essence of DevOps. And it extends much further than security alone. There are many aspects that play into DevOps: scripting, infrastructure, build and deploy, and more. Look forward to a later blog post with a deeper dive into DevOps.
